# cli-slot-machine

A slot machine for the CLI, built with Python. This is the first portfolio project for the Computer Science career journey on Codecademy.

The assignment is to create a terminal game using Python. Every student has to come up with their own ideas, and since I've been enjoying some online slot machines with my friends recently, I decided to recreate that for the terminal. Hopefully it'll save me some money as well.
